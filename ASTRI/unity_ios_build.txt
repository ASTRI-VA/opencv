iOS tracking README
=================

The iOS tracking uses the OpenCV library which is compiled as a framework. The framework
can be compiled with either libc++ or libstdc++ standard library.

The StaticLib uses the libstdc++ version by default because Unity iOS projects are
compiled with libstdc++ so the library must use the same standard library.


Compiling the OpenCV framework
==============================

The opencv source distribution contains a python script in the platforms/ios/build_framework.py location which compiles the framework. The ios folder here contains the modified files needed for compiling the framework. just replace the [opencv_src]/platforms/ios folded with this on and run “python build_framework.py <output_folder>”


Changes made to the compilation process
=======================================

Unity3d has a different version of the libpng library from opencv, so the opencv framework must be compiled without libpng when using it with unity.
To disable libpng, edit build_framework.py:
line 39:
Add "-DWITH_PNG=OFF" to cmakeargs

Unity uses libstdc++ standard library and is not compatible with libc++
To choose which standard library to use, edit the file:
ios/cmake/Modules/Platform/iOS.cmake

line 43:
set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-stdlib=libc++ -headerpad_max_install_names -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden")

possible values for stdlib:
 -stdlib=libc++
 -stdlib=libstdc++
